           - \ref InitParameters.enable_right_side_measure : Activating this parameter increases computation time.
           - \ref InitParameters.camera_resolution : Lower resolutions are faster to compute.

           - \ref RuntimeParameters.enable_depth : Avoiding the depth computation must be faster. However, it is required by most SDK features (tracking, spatial mapping, plane estimation, etc.)
           - \ref InitParameters.depth_mode : \ref DEPTH_MODE "DEPTH_MODE::PERFORMANCE" will run faster than \ref DEPTH_MODE "DEPTH_MODE::ULTRA".
           - \ref InitParameters.depth_stabilization : Stabilizing the depth requires an additional computation load as it enables tracking.

        This method is meant to be called frequently in the main loop of your application.

        \n By default, images are copied from GPU memory to CPU memory (RAM) when this function is called.
        \n If your application can use GPU images, using the \b type parameter can increase performance by avoiding this copy.
        \n If the provided \ref Mat object is already allocated and matches the requested image format, memory won't be re-allocated.
        \n
        \n <b>Measure size</b>
        \n By default, measures are returned in the resolution provided by \ref getCameraInformation().camera_configuration.resolution .
        \n However, custom resolutions can be requested. For example, requesting a smaller measure can help you speed up your application.

        \warning A sl::Mat resolution higher than the camera resolution <b>cannot</b> be requested.


        \param mat  : The \ref Mat to store the measure. The method will create the Mat if necessary at the proper resolution. If already created, it will just update its data (CPU or GPU depending on the MEM type).
        \param measure : Defines the measure you want (see \ref MEASURE). Default: \ref MEASURE "MEASURE::DEPTH".
        \param type : Defines on which memory the image should be allocated. Default: \ref MEM "MEM::CPU".
        \param image_size : If specified, define the resolution of the output sl::Mat. If set to \ref Resolution "Resolution(0,0)", the camera resolution will be taken. Default: (0,0).
        \return \ref ERROR_CODE "ERROR_CODE::SUCCESS" if the method succeeded.
        \return \ref ERROR_CODE "ERROR_CODE::INVALID_FUNCTION_PARAMETERS" if the view mode requires a module not enabled (\ref VIEW "VIEW::DEPTH" with \ref DEPTH_MODE "DEPTH_MODE::NONE" for example).
